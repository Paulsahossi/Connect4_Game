# Connect4_Game

This is a turn based game with a GUI, where "Red" player and "Blue" player take turns dropping their marker into a column until either someone wins, or the board is full. The Red or Blue Icons can be put anywhere. The columns is filled only from bottom to top.
The player wins if Red or Blue is put four in a row (whether vertically or horizontally or diagonally). The current player will be displayed on each turn. At the end of a game the winner is displayed and a window will be displayed to ask if players wants to play again.
